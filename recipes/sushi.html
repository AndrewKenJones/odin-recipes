    <h3>Description of dish;</h3>
        <p>Sushi is a Japanese dish that features medium-grained rice cooked in vinegar, served with raw or cooked seafood and a variety of toppings or fillings. Contrary to popular belief, rice is the main component of sushi, not raw fish.</p>
    <h3>Ingredigents;</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 & 1/3 cups water</li>
            <li>2/3 cup uncooked short-grain white rice</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>1 & 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>4 sheets nori seaweed sheets</li>
            <li>1/2 pound (lb) imitation crabmeat, flaked</li>    
            <li>1 avocado - peeled, pitted & sliced</li>  
            <li>1/2 cucumber, peeled & cut into small strips</li>     
            <li>2 tablespoons pickled ginger</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Cooking steps;</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Bring water to a boil in a medium pot; stir in rice. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Mix rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small bowl. Gently stir into cooked rice in the pot and set aside.</li>
            <li>Lay nori sheets on a baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Heat nori in the preheated oven until warm, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Center 1 nori sheet on a bamboo sushi mat. Use wet hands to spread a thin layer of rice on top. Arrange 1/4 of the crabmeat, avocado, cucumber, and pickled ginger over rice in a line down the center.</li>
            <li>Lift one end of the mat and roll it tightly over filling to make a complete roll. Repeat with remaining ingredients.</li>
            <li>Use a wet, sharp knife to cut each roll into 4 to 6 slices.</li>
        </ol>
